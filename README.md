    * ```\q```
3. From the projects root run `cp .env.example .env`

#### Build the Front End Assets with Mix
##### Using NPM:

  * You can watch assets with `npm run watch`

2. From the projects root folder run `yarn run dev` or `yarn run production`
  * You can watch assets with `yarn run watch`

###### And thats it with the caveat of setting up and configuring your development environment. I recommend [Laravel Homestead](https://laravel.com/docs/5.6/homestead)
